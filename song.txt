On my knees!
I'm begging for the answer's standing in front of me!
I believe there can be something from nothing!
He is the truth you seek, believe!

I've fought for so long
So many prices paid
To keep this train upon the tracks
So many times my dream's collapse

I'm on the edge of reality
My sanity, my sanity
Please take my hand and
Lead me to a place to rest my head

On my knees!
I'm begging for the answer's standing in front of me!
I believe there can be something from nothing!
He is the truth you seek, believe!

I've fought for so long
So many prices paid
To keep this train upon the tracks
So many times my dream's collapse

I'm on the edge of reality
My sanity, my sanity
Please take my hand and
Lead me to a place to rest my head

My head (my head), explodes (explodes)
My lungs (lungs), implode (implode)
Gauge out my eyes!
For the millionth time!

Demons in my head
They drown me with regret
This bottles all that I have
So many times my dreams collapse

I'm on the edge of reality
My sanity, my sanity
Please take my hand and
Lead me to a place to rest my head
Until my time comes to rest
I'll be here banging my fucking head
Banging My Fucking Head!
Yeah, Move!

On my knees!
I'm begging for the answer's standing in front of me!
